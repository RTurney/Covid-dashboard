# Covid dashboard app

This is a Covid dashboard project to upskill in react as suggested by this website:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/8-reactjs-project-ideas-to-start-learning-by-doing/

This project uses the [Open disease data api](https://disease.sh/) to fetch and display global covid data.

[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/index.html) is used to display the map data.

This application was originally deployed â€ o https://covid-datatracker-dashboard.herokuapp.com/ but is now no longer available.

## Current state on main

Currently this application allows users to see:

- The total global number of cases/deaths/cases today and deaths today at the head of the statistics board
- A statistics board with key info on each country/continent depending on what state the application is in
- A map with markers sized by case numbers for each country/continent
- The ability to switch between country/continent and vaccination data via the navbar
- Graphs following the total global number of cases/deaths/vaccinations since 2019

---

## Current state on Dev

Currently this application allows users to see:

- Interactive chloropleth map of continents with number of cases per Million
- Interactive chloropleth map of countires with number of cases per million
- Total number of global cases, deaths, cases today and deaths today displayed on Statistics board
- Key info on each countries' total number of cases and deaths displayed on the statistics board
- Key info on each Continent's total number of cases and deaths displayed on the statitsics board
- Graphs displaying global cases/deaths since 2019

---

## Project plan

Here is the basic figma design of the application in it's end-state:

<img src='src/assets/Covid-dashboard.png'>

The basic layout will be:

- A chloropleth map
- A statistics board detailing the key statistics for each country
- A header/navbar for the Covid dashboard
- Graphs of global data for cases/deaths/vaccinations
- A modal detailing key statistics for a country when clicked on

## Future plans

- Convert project from javascript and jsx to typescript
- Convert from a SPA to a multipage application
- Include greater amounts of information on each country/continent
- Find another api for vaccinations as the current one is broken
- Add a CI/CD pipeline with heroku deployment
