# Covid dashboard app

This is a Covid dashboard project to upskill in react as suggested by this website:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/8-reactjs-project-ideas-to-start-learning-by-doing/

This project uses the [Open disease data api](https://disease.sh/) to fetch and display global covid data.

[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/index.html) is used to display the map data.

This application is also deployed â€ o https://covid-datatracker-dashboard.herokuapp.com/ and can be run there.

## Current state on main

Currently this application allows users to see:

- the total number of cases
- The total number of cases today
- Total number of deaths worldwide
- The total number of deaths today
- Key info on each continent, displayd on the map
- Key info on each country, displayed on the map
- Key info on each countries vaccination numbers, displated on map
- Graphs displaying global case, death, vaccination numbers

---

## Project plan

Here is the basic figma design of the application in it's end-state:

<img src='public/Covid-dashboard.png'>

The basic layout will be:

- A map with markers for each country
- A statistics board detailing the key statistics for each country
- A header/navbar for the Covid dashboard
- Graphs of global data for cases/deaths/vaccinations
- A modal detailing key statistics for a country when clicked on

Key steps:

1. Create react app
2. Fetch statistics from api
3. Display statistics to app
4. Display map to app
5. Link map to statistics so users can click map for stats
6. Add multiple statistics so users can switch between relevant statistics on map
7. Add graphs of current trends in cases/deaths/vaccinations
